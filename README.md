# Soundscape Magazine

## What?

Soundscape Magazine's current website runs through the use of WordPress. I want to build the site without this and look to integrate it's own login in system, database and servers.

## Why?

I occasionally still write freelance projects for the website and used to run the site myself. I would like to combine some of my favourite things into a practice project to build a site that will utilise my skills and allow the team to move away from WordPress in the future, should it wish to.

## How?

I plan on creating servers for the site independently (the servers they currently use are not the best for the job and often crash/go down for "maintenance"). I would also like for the site to use it's own database for users to log in securely on the site, without the need for WordPress.

I also plan on looking to create a template that's very easy to use and manipulate should they wish to make any quick or minor changes to the site at any time.

### Tech Stack

Currently undecided - waiting on feedback from team on what they would like for the site.
